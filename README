 *  F1 Racing Circuit
 *
 *  Key bindings:
 *  p/P        Cycle through different Perspectives
 *  w/a/s/d    Move POV/Drive car (in POV mode)
 *  m/M        Cycle through different objects
 *  n/N        Switch between Day and Night Mode
 *  q          Toggle axes
 *  arrows     Change view angle in perspective mode
 *  0          Reset view angle
 *  ESC        Exit
 *  [          Lower light
 *  ]          Higher light
 *  F3         Toggle light distance
 *
 * use make command to get the binaries
 * ./final to view the project
 * To drive the car, stay in the F1 circuit mode and press w/a/s/d and space keys, to drive the car.
 * I have moved to SDL to support the car movements with multiple key presses at the same time .
 * The car has acceleration sounds when you move at high velocities, when you brake the brake lights illuminate, and pressing A or D moves the front wheels accordingly, the tires rotate too.
 * The car's engine cap is a Bezier curve rotated around x axis.(Pro tip: move to day mode to hear it clearly.)
 * I have 3 road functions, that creates a straight, right turn and left turn roads, which were used to piece together the circuit.
 * I have a Garage with cars, built a pit lane, a fence, a grandstand ,a tire barrier, support banner with textures, barricades on the sides of the straight road and red/white curbs in the turnings.
 * There is a night Mode the program launches with this mode. You can hear a rain background music, and you can see rain effects and splash effects made using Shaders.
 * The skybox is different when you switch between the night and day modes.
 * The entire code is mostly modular, reusing the support banners to add different objects was a good example for this.
 * I tried working on the collision detection, but the way I built the barricades made it difficult to implement it. If I had known in the start, would have built the circuit in a different way.
 * I tried simulating motion of the cars,but that felt to artificial, so did not include here.
